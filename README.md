# Zendesk Heading Anchor Enhancer

This is a simple web-based tool that enhances the HTML of Zendesk Help Center articles by inserting named anchors above each heading. This allows:

* Internal Table of Contents (TOC) created in the Zendesk UI to continue working.
* External links to point directly to specific sections of the article using meaningful and readable anchor names.

## Why this tool?

Zendesk automatically assigns long random `id` values (like `h_01JWS7ABCDEF...`) to headings, making external linking hard. This tool allows you to generate readable anchor links (like `#senders` or `#engagement-plan`).

## How to Use

1. Create your Zendesk article normally using the Zendesk UI.
2. Use the built-in TOC generator if desired.
3. Click the `</>` (source code) button in Zendesk and copy the full HTML.
4. Visit this tool (or open `anchor-enhancer.html` in your browser).
5. Paste the HTML into the input box.
6. Click **Add Anchors**.
7. Copy the modified HTML output and paste it back into the Zendesk source editor.

## Features

* Skips headings that already have anchors.
* Ensures both `name` and `id` attributes are included for broad browser compatibility.
* Leaves Zendesk's autogenerated IDs in place to avoid breaking internal links.
