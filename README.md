# Zendesk Anchorfixer

**Zendesk Anchorfixer** is a simple web-based tool that enhances the HTML of Zendesk Help Center articles by:

- Inserting named anchors directly inside each heading (`<h1>`–`<h6>`) using clean, human-readable slugs.
- Updating all Table of Contents (TOC) links to point to those new slugs instead of Zendesk’s autogenerated hash IDs (like `#h_01JWS7ABCDEF`).

## Why use this?

Zendesk generates cryptic heading IDs, making URLs long and unreadable when linking to a section. This tool gives you anchor links like `#create-a-list` instead of `#h_01JWS73ND8SYFD6WJRHRQ8DXQV`, improving readability and usability.

## How to Use

1. Create your Zendesk article normally in the Zendesk UI.
2. (Optional) Use the built-in TOC generator.
3. Click the `</>` (source code) button and copy the full HTML.
4. Open `index.html` (Zendesk Anchorfixer) in your browser.
5. Paste the HTML into the input box.
6. Click **Fix Anchors**.
7. Copy the updated output and paste it back into the Zendesk source editor.

## Features

- Adds `name` and `id` attributes using slugified heading text.
- Avoids adding duplicate anchors if one already exists.
- Updates all TOC links to match the slugified headings.
- Leaves existing readable anchors untouched.
- Works entirely client-side—no data is sent anywhere.

## Example

**Before:**

```html
<a href="/hc/en-us/articles/1234567890#h_01ABCDEF1234567">Create a List</a>
<h2 id="h_01ABCDEF1234567">Create a List</h2>
